# Ocean-Heat-Uptake
Scientific project that investigates the extent to which the ocean heat content has increased using the EN4 dataset.

<b> Abstract </b>


The Earth’s energy imbalance is responsible for driving the global warming, that is increasingly being witnessedin climate systems worldwide.
As most of this energy accumulates in the oceans, Ocean Heat Content (OHC) changes can be used to assess this warming.
However, limited ocean observations coverage makes estimatingchanges in the OHC a significant challenge.
In this report, Met Office’s EN4 analyses are evaluated for theirability to estimate trends in global OHC change, for 1950-2018.
This was again used to quantify the OHCchange and its regional variations.
The analyses were found to be adequate in estimating OHC, when avoidingtime periods and regions of low observational influence as they are heavily influenced by the assumptions madein dealing with regions of no observations.
The sampling error was found to be most significant at depths and inthe Southern Hemisphere.
From 1970-2016, the OHC increased by 24.4× 10^22 J for the 0-2000 m layer, with 74% of the total change in the upper ocean (above 700m).
The ocean heat uptake experienced an acceleration around 1997, which is likely linked to a recovery in OHC from the volcanic eruption Mt Pinatubo (1991) masking the acceleration that would have otherwise been observed.
In addition, it was likely linked to a reduced samplingerror from an increase in observational coverage from the Argo programme.
The warming was strongest in the Southern and tropical/subtropical Atlantic Oceans, for periods of both low and high observational influence, revealing a robust footprint of global warming.
